# Router Rebooter

Python based code used to reset Internet Router </b>

<b>WHY</b></b>
<p>The area around my home has unstable internet connection so oftentime I find the internet suddenly has no connection.</p>
<p>It ends up requiring me to go to the router to reset it to resume the normal connection.</p>

<b>SOLUTION</b></b>
<p>This code was written to solve this mentioned problem.</p>
<p>With using Raspberry Pi to control the relay connected to Router On-Off switch, the code keeps pinging Google.com to check internet connectivity and send controlling command to relay to reset if the connection losts.</p>
